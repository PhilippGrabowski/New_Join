                    <p>Join is a project management and workflow system. It uses a visual board with columns
                        representing
                        different stages of work to provide a clear view of the workflow. Work items are represented as
                        cards and their movement across the board indicates progress.
                        Join focuses on limiting work in progress to improve efficiency and avoid overloading the team.
                        It promotes transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement by visualizing work and
                        enabling self-organization. Also it encourages teams to pull work into the system based on
                        available capacity rather than pushing more work in.

                        <span class="step">Visualise your tasks. Create a card for each task. In doing so, set the
                            priority, time frame and subtasks and assign them to your contacts</span>

                        <span class="step">Move tasks across the board. As work progresses, move the task cards from
                            left to right across the columns. For example, when a task is being actively worked on, move
                            it to the "in progress" column. When it's completed, move it to the "Done" column.</span>

                            board to see how tasks are flowing through the workflow. Identify any bottlenecks or areas
                            where work is getting stuck. This visibility helps you identify and address issues
                            promptly.</span>
